Thesis Topic: Prediction of NMR permeability based on conventional well logging data using Artificial Neural Networks (Under the Supervision of Dr. Mohammad Emami Niri)

# Abstract

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logs can provide information on some critical reservoir characteristics, such as permeability, which are rarely obtainable from conventional well logs. Nevertheless, high cost and operational constraints limit the wide application of NMR logging tools. In this study, a machine learning (ML)-based procedure is developed for fast and accurate estimation of NMR-derived permeability from conventional logs. Following a comprehensive preprocessing on the collected data, the procedure is trained and tested on a well log dataset, with selected conventional logs as inputs, and NMR-derived permeability as target, shallow and deep learning (DL) methods are applied to estimate permeability from selected conventional logs through artificial production of NMR-derived information from the input data. Three supervised ML algorithms are utilized and evaluated, including gradient boosting regressor (GBR), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) neural network, group method of data handling (GMDH), and residual dense neural network (Res DNN). Additionally, a modified two-dimensional CNN (named as Residual 2D-CNN) is developed which is fed by artificial 2D feature maps, generated from available conventional logs. By comparing the output of each model with the permeability derived from NMR log, it is illustrated that nonlinear machine and deep learning techniques are helpful in estimation of NMR permeability.
